# swap-playing-cards
Swap two cards by pressing a button. Cards displayed using cardsJS. Vector playing cards by Chris Aguilar.
A random selection of cards are shown on the screen and the user can pick two cards to swap at a time.

The user can select the left card and the right card to swap. 
The cards themselves are entered as follows: one letter or number for the rank, and one letter for the suit.

For example, if the user wishes to select the queen of spades, the user types in "QS" into the input box.

The program also checks the card array to make sure the swap is a valid swap. 
Entering a card that does not exist or two cards that are in the wrong order will not initiate any swaps.
